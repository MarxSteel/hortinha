# EatLocal

Initially developed for West Sacramento by the 2015 Fellows.

Eat Local maps restaurants, grocery stores, and farmers markets using or selling locally-grown food within West Sacramento so that citizens who want to support locally-grown food can easily find and purchase it. This project was built during the Code for America 2015 Fellowship Build Week, primarily used as way for fellows in the West Sacramento team to get to know each otherâ€™s work styles better and build something useful.
